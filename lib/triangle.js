const Triangle = '<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />'

// points
// A list of points, each number separated by a space, comma, EOL, or a line feed character with additional whitespace permitted. Each point must contain two numbers: an x coordinate and a y coordinate. So, the list (0,0), (1,1), and (2,2) could be written as 0, 0 1, 1 2, 2. The drawing then closes the path, so a final straight line would be drawn from (2,2) to (0,0).
